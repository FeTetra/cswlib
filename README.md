# cswlib
## A rewrite of cwlib in C#

This does NOT recreate the entirety of Craftworld Toolkit. Rather it is a replica of the library files found in the toolkit
software, as well as files that were once used in LBP itself, but now in C#.

This will allow others, including but not limited to Craftworld HUB, to be able to use LBP libraries within Unity and Godot
at their leisure. Please go support the original authors of the code.
